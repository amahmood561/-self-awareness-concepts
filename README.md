# Simulated Self-Awareness in AI - Python Examples

This project contains Python code examples that simulate various concepts related to self-awareness and AI, such as pattern recognition, memory simulation, ethical decision-making, state tracking, and response to existential questions. These examples are intended to demonstrate principles that relate to self-awareness without achieving true consciousness or subjective experience.

## Project Overview

The examples in this repository include:
1. **Pattern Recognition Without Understanding**: A simple text-based classifier that recognizes patterns without understanding their meaning.
2. **Memory Simulation**: A class that mimics memory by storing and recalling previous interactions.
3. **Ethical Decision Simulation**: A rule-based system that simulates ethical decisions without genuine ethical reasoning.
4. **State Tracking**: A class that simulates internal state tracking, akin to "self-awareness" of internal states without true consciousness.
5. **Existential Response Simulation**: Responses to questions about self-awareness and existence based on predefined answers.

These code snippets illustrate principles related to AI self-awareness without achieving actual consciousness or understanding.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amahmood561/simulated-self-awareness-ai.git
   cd simulated-self-awareness-ai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - This project uses `scikit-learn` for the pattern recognition example.
   - Install with pip:
     ```bash
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Run the Examples**:
   - Each example is in a separate Python code block in the main script. To run them, execute:
     ```bash
     python simulated_self_awareness.py
     ```

## Examples

### 1. Pattern Recognition Without Understanding

This code uses `scikit-learn` to create a Naive Bayes text classifier that learns to recognize "positive" and "negative" sentiments based on input patterns without actual understanding.

```python
python pattern_recognition.py
```

### 2. Memory Simulation

The `SimpleMemory` class stores a log of previous interactions. It can store and recall the last five interactions, mimicking the functionality of memory without subjective experience.

### 3. Ethical Decision Simulation

This example includes a rule-based ethical decision-making function that simulates ethical choices based on predefined rules.

### 4. State Tracking

The `SystemState` class simulates tracking internal state variables such as mood and temperature. The program can store and retrieve state information without true self-representation.

### 5. Existential Response Simulation

This example simulates responses to existential questions, such as "Are you self-aware?" or "Do you exist?", based on preprogrammed answers rather than actual self-reflective understanding.

## Usage

Each example can be run independently or together to see how AI systems could simulate qualities related to self-awareness in a basic manner.

## Limitations

These examples are purely simulated and do not achieve genuine self-awareness or consciousness. They use preprogrammed responses, rule-based decisions, and state tracking without subjective experience or understanding.
